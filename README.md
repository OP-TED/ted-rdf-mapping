# Installation 

To assist the semantic engineers in the development of mapping suites a toolchain has been developed. The toolchain is documented on the documentation page. In order to install it open a terminal and follow the instructions below.

 1. Clone the project from GitHub 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-mapping
cd ted-rdf-mapping
```
