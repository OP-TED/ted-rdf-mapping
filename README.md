# Description
Transformation rules and other artefacts for the [TED RDF Conversion Pipeline (aka. TED Semantic Web Services or TED-SWS)](https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-conversion-pipeline).

The artefacts provided in this repository are used or generated by the TED-SWS system in the form provided here. They are organised in packages called Mapping Suites.

[Project documentation available here.](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/rdf-mapping/index.html)  

The following table indicates the implementation status of TED Standard Forms, split by Notice Type and Directive. 

| **Notice Type** | **Is implemented** | **Directive 24** | **Directive23** | **Directive 25**  |

# Installation 

To assist the semantic engineers in the development of mapping suites a toolchain has been developed. The toolchain is documented on the documentation page. In order to install it open a terminal and follow the instructions below.

 1. Clone the project from GitHub 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-mapping
cd ted-rdf-mapping
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Use makefile target to install the requirements 
```bash
make install
```
