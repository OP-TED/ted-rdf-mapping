# Description

> ⚠️ The TED schema forms are the **former standard forms** and have been replaced by [eForms](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/index.html), newer RML rules for eForms can be found at [OP-TED/ted-rdf-mapping-eforms](https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-mapping-eforms).

This repository contains RML rules to transform [Standard TED schema forms](https://ted.europa.eu/en/simap/standard-ted-schema-forms-in-pdf) to RDF that conforms to version 3.0 of the [eProcurement Ontology (ePO)](https://github.com/OP-TED/ePO) and are currently used by the [TED RDF Conversion Pipeline](https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-conversion-pipeline) to produce RDF for forms sent before 25 October 2023.

The artefacts provided in this repository are used or generated by the TED-SWS system in the form provided here. They are organised in packages called Mapping Suites.

[Project documentation available here.](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/SWS/mapping_suite/index.html)  

The following table indicates the implementation status of TED Standard Forms, split by Notice Type and Directive.

# Installation 

To assist the semantic engineers in the development of mapping suites a toolchain has been developed. The toolchain is documented on the documentation page. In order to install it open a terminal and follow the instructions below.

 1. Clone the project from GitHub 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-mapping
cd ted-rdf-mapping
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Use makefile target to install the requirements 
```bash
make install
```
