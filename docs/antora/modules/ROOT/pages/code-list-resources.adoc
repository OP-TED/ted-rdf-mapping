=== Code List Resources for Mappings

The table below provides a list of resources that are used to map the various code lists used in the XML files to URIs in the RDF representation.

The *JSON* and *CSV* format files can be found at the following location:
https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-mapping/tree/main/mappings/package_F03/transformation/resources[https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-mapping/tree/main/mappings/package_F03/transformation/resources] +
The *specific URIs* are directly used in the
https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-mapping/tree/main/mappings/package_F03/transformation/mappings[technical mapping files], and they can also be found in the
https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-mapping/blob/main/mappings/package_F03/transformation/conceptual_mappings.xlsx[conceptual mapping file].

*Imortant note:* Please ensure you change the path of the link to the tag that you are checking. For example, for the `tx1.1.delta` tag, the links mentioned above will be:
