=== Resources for Code List Mappings

The table below provides a list of resources that are used to map the various code lists used in the XML files to URIs in the RDF representation.

In case of mapping Standard Form `F03` the *JSON* and *CSV* format files can be found at the following location:
https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-mapping/tree/main/mappings/package_F03/transformation/resources[https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-mapping/tree/main/mappings/package_F03/transformation/resources] +
The *specific URIs* are directly used in the
https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-mapping/tree/main/mappings/package_F03/transformation/mappings[technical mapping files], and they can also be found in the
https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-mapping/blob/main/mappings/package_F03/transformation/conceptual_mappings.xlsx[conceptual mapping file].

*Imortant note:* Please ensure you adapt the above paths to the resources to match the tag and mapping suite package that you wish to check. For example, for the `tx1.3.beta` tag and for form `F20`, the links mentioned above will be:

* https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-mapping/tree/tx1.3.beta/mappings/package_F20/transformation/resources
* https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-mapping/tree/tx1.3.beta/mappings/package_F20/transformation/mappings
* https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-mapping/blob/tx1.3.beta/mappings/package_F20/transformation/conceptual_mappings.xlsx
