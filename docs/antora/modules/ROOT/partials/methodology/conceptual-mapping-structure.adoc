== Conceptual mapping structure

In this section we describe the structure of the mapping file that we aim to create as the result of the described mapping process. The mapping file is an Excel workbook containing multiple worksheets. This workbook is generated from a Google Sheets document, where it can be prepared, revised, and refined by multiple contributors in a collaborative fashion. The template for this spreadsheet is provided https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iSk02YD7lfPByKnBDU4Z2XiBjY6zCqMP79uyydiQxxU/edit#gid=0[here]. This template informs software developers and knowledge engineers alike about what should be the content of such a mapping file.

It consists of several important worksheets:

* Metadata sheet: provides important technical and descriptive information about the mapping suite
* Resources sheet: provides the list of resources used in the technical mappings. This list is used to automatically populate the mapping suite with indicated resources files.
* Rules sheet: provides the actual set of mapping rules
* Misc: there are additional optional worksheets added by the semantic engineers to manage additional information.

The version number should be increased for each “released” version of the mapping table that is different from the previously released version, following https://semver.org/[semantic versioning] practices.|Example values: 0.1.0 / 1.0.0-beta / 1.1.0 / 2.3.2

Ranges should be also allowed. For multiple versions a comma separated list or ranges of the form (_startVersion, endVersion)_, or a combination of these two can be used. For any value the character * can be used.|Example values: R2.0.9.S05 (this includes all intermediary versions of R2.0.9.S05.E01, such as R2.0.9.S05.E01_001-20210730) /
