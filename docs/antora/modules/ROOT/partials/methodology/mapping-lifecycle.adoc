== Mapping development lifecycle
:page-partial:

The purpose of this section is to provide a high-level overview of the mapping development lifecycle before the mapping suites are ready to be used for transformation in production settings.

The diagram in <<mapping-lifecycle>> describes the complete mapping development lifecycle.

The process starts by **deciding which notice type to map**. The notice classification scheme currently considered are the https://simap.ted.europa.eu/web/simap/standard-forms-for-public-procurement["standard forms"] and the https://simap.ted.europa.eu/web/simap/eforms["eForms"]. Once the target form is selected, **a set of representative shall be selected** in order to serve as a test set for the developed mapping .

The notice classification scheme is usually subject to regulations and described in multiple forms starting from PDF documents, XSD schemes, and other documents. All possible documentation and modelling artefacts are **analysed in order to produce a conceptual mapping** (described in the <<_conceptual-mapping-structure,Conceptual mapping structure>> section). This artefact, stored as a workbook, establishes the correspondence of the TED notice fields, to XPath expressions, and to EPO structures.

Once the conceptual mapping is established between the XPath expressions and ontology structures (first layer of <<mapping-lifecycle>>), **a corresponding technical mapping is implemented** (second layer of <<mapping-lifecycle>>). This technical mapping consists of a set of mapping rules expressed in https://rml.io/specs/rml/[RDF Mapping Language (RML)] and it represents a translation of the conceptual mapping into a formal language which can be automatically executed by a transformation engine, such as https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java[RMLMapper].

Reading RML, for revision or debugging purposes, can be difficult. To ease this process, the *RML files can be turned into a comprehensive HTML report*. This human friendly form can serve, for example, parsing the set of conceptual mapping rules and the technical ones, in order to *check their completeness or consistency*.

Furthermore, after the **representative sample** is transformed with the implemented technical mapping rules in order to enable quality control.
We proceed to the third layer **Validation** of <<mapping-lifecycle>>, where we depict SPARQL and SHACL validation steps which evaluate the quality of the produced data, and if violations and inconsistencies are found the mechanism will point which parts of the conceptual mapping seem to have an issue.
Once the validation is passed successfully, in the fourth layer of <<mapping-lifecycle>> **Dissemination**, the Mapping Suite is available (for a Notice Type) and they are stored in the https://docs.ted.europa.eu/rdf-mapping/repository-structure.html[Mapping Suite Repository] to be used by the transformation pipeline, when necessary.
