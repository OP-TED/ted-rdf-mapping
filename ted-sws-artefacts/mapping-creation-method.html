<p>The purpose of this section is to give a high-level overview of the process that we follow to create the mapping rules that are used to transform TED notices available as XML files into RDF triples that use ePO terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The methodology that we describe here, focuses on a few steps and artefacts that are at the core of the diagram depicted in <a href="#mapping-creation">Figure 1</a>.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We started out building our methodology by following this theoretical framework, but based on what we learned from our practical experience with manually creating such mappings we have enhanced and refined the mapping creation process. It is safe to assume that as we learn even more from creating further mappings, the process will be further refined and this document will evolve.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The focus here is on describing the steps how the <strong>conceptual mapping</strong> and the <strong>technical mapping</strong> are created.</p>

<h3 id="_steps_involved_in_the_conceptual_mapping_process"><a class="anchor" href="#_steps_involved_in_the_conceptual_mapping_process"></a>Steps involved in the conceptual mapping process</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The conceptual mapping (see structure description here ) is the first artefact that must be created. It requires a thorough understanding of the content of a given form, and all the related concepts in the ePO ontology. It will likely involve several rounds of discussions with people who have deep knowledge in these areas, to ensure that the conceptual mapping is done right. Below we look at certain sub-steps involved in developing the conceptual mapping.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_identify_the_form_elements_and_the_corresponding_xml_elements_and_xpaths_to_be_mapped"><a class="anchor" href="#_identify_the_form_elements_and_the_corresponding_xml_elements_and_xpaths_to_be_mapped"></a>Identify the Form Elements (and the Corresponding XML Elements and XPaths) to be Mapped</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To identify the XML elements that contain information to be mapped to RDF we look at:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The “Standard Forms to eForms” mapping table that corresponds to the form that we are trying to map. This provides us both with the list of the form elements, as well as XPath expressions that can be used to retrieve the appropriate information (from XML elements, attributes, etc) from the XML data. *Note: *Some of these XPaths are pretty straight forward, but other times they can be quite complicated, or multiple XPaths are used to retrieve alternative values. We need to test these XPaths, and see if we can write simpler, better and/or more appropriate ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>TED_EXPORT.xsd</strong> schema file, corresponding to the XML version that we are trying to map. <strong>Note:</strong> Special attention should be paid to the structure of the XML document (especially when we have repeating elements, or multiple levels of nesting, sometimes involving elements with very similar names)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>PDF form</strong> that we are trying to map, to make sure that all the elements are covered and the correct semantic of the fields has been identified
Individual XML notices available in our test data set, as well as data extracted from these sample notices and compiled in tables to provide an overview of the different values that are contained in the test regarding a certain field.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_identify_eform_business_terms_bt_corresponding_to_the_xml_elements_optional"><a class="anchor" href="#_identify_eform_business_terms_bt_corresponding_to_the_xml_elements_optional"></a>Identify eForm Business Terms (BT) corresponding to the XML elements (optional)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although this is not necessary for the conversion of the Standard Form XML to RDF data, from a future-oriented perspective it is still useful to identify the eForm Business Terms corresponding to each Standard Form element. This should be pretty straight forward by looking at the “Standard Forms to eForms” mapping table.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_identify_epo_terms_classes_and_relations_that_correspond_to_xml_elements_and_their_relationships"><a class="anchor" href="#_identify_epo_terms_classes_and_relations_that_correspond_to_xml_elements_and_their_relationships"></a>Identify ePO terms (classes and relations) that correspond to XML elements and their relationships</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Basically, in this step, we need to identify the appropriate classes, class attributes, and relationships between the ePO classes that can be used to represent the information contained in the various XML elements. This requires a deep understanding of the ePO model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Identifying the relevant ePO terms might not be very straightforward in some cases, as there is quite a significant difference between the conceptualisation and abstractisations made in the two models, and we can often encounter situations where even the names used for the same concept might differ significantly in the two models. Therefore, in this step it is <strong>highly recommended</strong> to consult with people who have a high level of knowledge of the structure and content of the ePO model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make sure to <strong>document</strong> any problems and discrepancies that we discover, which prevents the creation of a perfect (one-to-one) mapping. This documentation should happen both on the spreadsheet (e.g. by highlighting problematic cells in certain colours and/or adding comments to them), but also by describing issues in a separate, dedicated, document that can be reviewed and addressed by ePO experts. For more on the documentation process see section below.</p>

<h4 id="_identify_value_sets_in_xml"><a class="anchor" href="#_identify_value_sets_in_xml"></a>Identify value sets in XML</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To identify the value sets (i.e. the possible different values) that are used in the XML data, either as certain element names, or attribute values), we need to look at:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>TED_EXPORT.xsd</strong> schema file, corresponding to the XML version that we are trying to map,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The values that appear in the sample XML notices, summarised in various ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>PDF form</strong> that we are trying to map, to see if the form specifies an obvious value set, e.g. by means of checkboxes or radio buttons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consult the authority tables used in the EPO available from the <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/authority-tables">EU Vocabularies</a></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this step we should identify the different vocabularies that are referenced by ePO attributes and relationships that are involved in the mapping of a certain XML element, and we should gain some familiarity with that vocabulary. At minimum we should know what namespace they are using and what are some of the values and how are they encoded (i.e. which properties they are using to encode labels, ids, etc).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Important:</strong> The path to the source files should be specified relative to the RML file(s). So, if the RML mapping files are in the transformation/mappings folder (as described above), then the sources they define should point to the <code>../../data/data.xml</code> file, respectively to the various <code>.json</code>, <code>.csv</code> and/or <code>.xml</code> files in the <code>./resources</code> folder</p>

<h4 id="_write_yarrrml_rules_optional"><a class="anchor" href="#_write_yarrrml_rules_optional"></a>Write YARRRML Rules (optional)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the initial phase of our mapping creation process we started out writing the mapping rules in <a href="https://rml.io/yarrrml/spec/">YARRRML</a> (a human readable text-based representation for declarative generation rules), instead of RML, because it seemed simpler, and the end result was more human friendly. However, as we gained more experience and confidence in how the mappings should be defined, we realised that writing RML rules directly could be even more powerful, and we started to rewrite all our YARRRML mapping rules into RML. If this transition proves to be successful, and writing RML rules directly will be more convenient, our process will not require writing YARRRML rules in the future. This is the reason for why this step is optional. It could be useful for small test cases, quick demos, or showcases, and in cases when some people are more familiar with YARRRML than RML. If people decide to write YARRRML rules, the next step will become unnecessary, as the RML rules will be automatically generated from the YARRRML rules, using <a href="cli-toolchain.html" class="xref page">dedicated tools</a> that were developed for this purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since this step is optional, we will not describe in detail the individual issues that need to be worked on, but they are in principle the same as the ones described in the next section.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_write_rml_rules"><a class="anchor" href="#_write_rml_rules"></a>Write RML rules</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If in the previous step we have defined the mapping rules in YARRRML, then this step consists of the simple action of executing <a href="cli-toolchain.html" class="xref page">the tool that generates RML out of YARRRML</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of which file we chose to define manually, the YARRRML or the RML, at the end of this step we will need to have an RML mapping file that should be able to convert an XML notice into a corresponding RDF graph.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>In the rest of this section we assume that the RML rules are being written manually</strong>, as this is the solution that promises the biggest potential benefitand this is the approach that we would like to pursue in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The technical mappings are written in the <a href="https://rml.io/">RML mapping language</a>. The version of RML used is <a href="https://github.com/julianrojas87/rmlmapper-java">5.0.0-r362</a>, which was recommended to us by Julian Rojas, its principal developer, in which the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp">XPath</a> version <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/">3.1</a> is supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_prefix_definition"><a class="anchor" href="#_prefix_definition"></a>prefix definition</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To specify the technical mappings in RML, we start with the definition of the prefixes that are used in the mapping file. For example for the ePO ontology, we would define the epo prefix name as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>@prefix epo: &lt;http://data.europa.eu/a4g/ontology#&gt; .</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The prefix names and their values, which are used in the RML file, should be ALL maintained in the <a href="https://github.com/meaningfy-ws/ted-sws/blob/feature/TED-311/ted_sws/resources/prefixes/prefixes.json"><code>prefixes.json</code></a> resource file. If the content of that file is maintained and kept up to date properly, the entire prefix declaration section of the RML file could be automatically generated, and re-generated when necessary. (Note: Besides the individual prefixes, please also check out the array that is the assigned value to the <code>rml_rules</code> key).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_triplesmap"><a class="anchor" href="#_triplesmap"></a>TriplesMap</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next step after the definition of prefixes, is to define the various TriplesMaps to create class instances. For example, let&#8217;s see an organisation&#8217;s technical mapping.</p>

<p>TODO: Ask Ibrahim to help provide some items and text snippets about the various technical mapping aspects that are challenging, interesting, or where multiple solutions were possible and certain design decisions have been taken, for example, the generation of UUID, using external files for controlled values, handling repeatable/nested tags, etc.</p>

<p>While writing the mapping rules, make sure to document any issues that you are not able to solve, or that raise interesting questions, in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nnvD6XXYPSDzv_VukDHswzYKd_-PDUMe7E-kUGHNcc8/edit?usp=sharing">Observations/Questions about mapping generation</a> Google doc. If warranted, a Jira task should be also created to address the given issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Problems that were successfully resolved should be integrated in this guide, as recommendations, e.g. in one of the above sections, and marked as [SOLVED] in the document. Unless the problem turns out to be fairly trivial, or there is only one obvious solution to it. It would be recommended NOT to delete the issue from the “Problem description” document, so that we can keep track of the different issues, and the thinking that went into choosing certain solutions.</p>
