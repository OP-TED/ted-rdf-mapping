<p>The purpose of this guide is to describe a <strong>methodology for creating mapping rules</strong> that can be used for transforming XML data representing the content of the TED “Standard” Forms into RDF graphs that conform to the <a href="https://github.com/OP-TED/ePO">ePO ontology</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The methodology will rely on various resources generated by earlier attempts (e.g. those created by Everis), outcomes of projects that work on related issues (e.g. by Deloitte e.a.), as well as the input of a number of people with in-depth knowledge of the ePO ontology, XML, RML and expertise in Semantic Web technologies in general.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The mappings generated by this methodology are to be used as part of <a href="https://meaningfy-ws.github.io/ted-sws/ted-sws/_attachments/ted-sws-architecture/index.html?goto=1:1:36">the notice transformation workflow</a> for <strong>all</strong> <a href="https://ted.europa.eu/TED/browse/browseByMap.do">Tenders Electronic Daily (TED)</a> notices conforming to "Standard" forms that are published in the TED XML format, into RDF format, in order to make it available for querying through a SPARQL endpoint.</p>

<p>The purpose of this section is to provide a high-level overview of the mapping development lifecycle before the mapping suites are ready to be used for transformation in production settings.</p>

<p>The diagram in <a href="#mapping-lifecycle">Figure 1</a> describes the complete mapping development lifecycle.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process starts by <strong>deciding which notice type to map</strong>. The notice classification scheme currently considered are the <a href="https://simap.ted.europa.eu/web/simap/standard-forms-for-public-procurement">"standard forms"</a> and the <a href="https://simap.ted.europa.eu/web/simap/eforms">"eForms"</a>. In the future, however, it is likely that new classification schemes will follow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the target form is selected, <strong>a set of representative shall be selected</strong> in order to serve as a test set for the developed mapping.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The notice classification scheme is usually subject to regulations and described in multiple forms starting from PDF documents, XSD schemes, and other documents. All possible documentation and modelling artefacts are <strong>analysed in order to produce a conceptual mapping</strong> (see <a href="conceptual-mapping-structure.html" class="xref page">conceptual mapping structure</a> ). This artefact, stored as a workbook, establishes the correspondence of the TED notice fields, to XPath expressions and to EPO structures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the conceptual mapping is established between the XPath expressions and ontology structures, <strong>a corresponding technical mapping is implemented</strong>. This technical mapping consists of a set of mapping rules expressed in <a href="https://rml.io/specs/rml/">RDF Mapping Language (RML)</a> and it represents a translation of the conceptual mapping into a formal language which can be automatically executed by a transformation engine, such as <a href="https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java">RMLMapper</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reading RML, for revision or debugging purposes, can be difficult. To ease this process, the <strong>RML files can be turned into a comprehensive HTML report</strong>. This human friendly form can serve, for example, parsing the set of conceptual mapping rules and the technical ones, in order to <strong>check their completeness or consistency</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That completeness check is a manual step but not the only quality assurance mechanism foreseen in the lifecycle process. Grace to the setup and conventions of the conceptual mapping file, it permits generation of several additional artefacts (described elsewhere). In particular, <strong>a set of SPARQL assertion queries can be generated</strong>. These queries can be used to assess whether the fields mapped in the conceptual mapping are found in that form in the RDF file generated from an XMl notice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To put the SPARQL assertions into practice, the sample data, initially selected <strong>sample data is automatically transformed into RDF</strong>, using the RML mapping rules. And on each output, the <strong>SPARQL queries are applied</strong> resulting in a report, which indicates which query yielded a positive and which a negative result. The resulting validation reports can be checkecd to detect mistakes in the RML transformation rules or teh conceptual mapping.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The final step consists of another assessment of the generated data: the <strong>fingerprinting</strong>. This procedure generates a report which <strong>reconstructs the data shape instantiated in a particular notice</strong>. This permits identification of mistakes with regard to the EPO ontology.</p>
