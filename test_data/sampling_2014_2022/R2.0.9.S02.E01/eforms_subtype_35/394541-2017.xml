                  <P>The initial estimated value of each lot was calculated by taking an average of total fees for the number of learners over 3 years for existing qualifications as stated in the background document provided with the pre-qualification questionnaire.</P>
                  <P>The total final value of the lot has been estimated based upon the restricted approved qualification period of 5 years when the successful bidders will have the exclusive right to deliver the qualifications. The value was calculated using the successful bidders' fee for each qualification in the lot multiplied by the estimated number of learners for that qualification over five years. The amount does not include ad hoc fees such as re-sits, late entry, appeals and replacement certificates.</P>
