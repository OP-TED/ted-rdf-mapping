The reference period which will be taken into account will be the last five (5) years preceding the submission deadline.</P><P>The candidate has provided services under at least two (2) contracts each with a budget of at least EUR 1 000 000 (proportion of the contract carried out by the legal entity being at least EUR 1 000 000) in the fields specified below which were implemented fully or partially in the last five years 5 preceding the deadline set for submission of applications. This means that a project considered acceptable could be started or completed at any time during the period mentioned but it does not have to be started and completed during that period, nor implemented during the entire period. Candidates are allowed to refer either to projects completed within the reference period (although started earlier) or to projects not yet completed. In the first case, the project will be considered in its whole if proper evidence of performance is provided (statement or certificate from the entity which awarded the contract, proof of final payment). In case of projects still ongoing, only the portion satisfactorily completed during the reference period will be taken into consideration. This portion will have to be supported by documentary evidence (similarly to projects completed) also detailing its value. If a candidate has implemented the project in a consortium, the percentage that the candidate has successfully completed must be clear from the documentary evidence, together with a description of the nature of the services provided if the selection criteria relating to the pertinence of the experience have been used. Documentary evidence is not required at the application stage but will be requested with the invitation to tender.</P><P>The following fields of specialization are:</P><P>(a) institutional support in developing capacities of the national veterinary services in design and implementation of disease control programs;</P><P>(b) institutional support in preparation and implementation of legislation covered by the chapter 12 of the acquis.</P></TECHNICAL_PROFESSIONAL_INFO><TECHNICAL_PROFESSIONAL_MIN_LEVEL><P>A reference project/contract may cover one or both fields of specialization.

Some examples of when it may not be considered appropriate by the contracting authority are when the tender rely in majority on the capacities of other entities or when they rely on key criteria. If the tenderer relies on other entities it must prove to the contracting authority that it will have at its disposal the resources necessary for performance of the contract, for example by producing a commitment on the part of those entities to place those resources at its disposal. Such entities, for instance the parent company of the economic operator, must respect the same rules of eligibility - notably that of nationality – and must comply with the selection criteria for which the economic operator relies on them. Furthermore, the data for this third entity for the relevant selection criterion should be included in the tender in a separate document. Proof of the capacity will also have to be provided when requested by the contracting authority.</P><P>With regard to technical and professional criteria, an economic operator may only rely on the capacities of other entities where the latter will perform the works or services for which these capacities are required.</P><P>With regard to economic and financial criteria, the entities upon whose capacity the tenderer relies, become jointly and severally liable for the performance of the contract.</P></TECHNICAL_PROFESSIONAL_MIN_LEVEL></LEFTI><PROCEDURE><PT_RESTRICTED/><NO_CONTRACT_COVERED_GPA/><NOTICE_NUMBER_OJ>2019/S 237-580468</NOTICE_NUMBER_OJ><DATE_RECEIPT_TENDERS>2020-11-27</DATE_RECEIPT_TENDERS><TIME_RECEIPT_TENDERS>11:00</TIME_RECEIPT_TENDERS><DATE_DISPATCH_INVITATIONS>2020-12-28</DATE_DISPATCH_INVITATIONS><LANGUAGES><LANGUAGE VALUE="EN"/></LANGUAGES><DURATION_TENDER_VALID TYPE="MONTH">3</DURATION_TENDER_VALID></PROCEDURE><COMPLEMENTARY_INFO><NO_RECURRENT_PROCUREMENT/><INFO_ADD><P>Financial data to be provided by the candidate in the standard application form must be expressed in EUR.
