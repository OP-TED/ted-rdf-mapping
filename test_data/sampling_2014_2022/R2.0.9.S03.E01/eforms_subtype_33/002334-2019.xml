The Council are carrying out call offs for care and support services in a number of extra care housing schemes in conjunction with the framework application process. Providers are asked to submit innovate proposals through the mini-competition process for 5 Extra care housing lots that support people aged 55 and over within existing accommodation. The 5 lots fall into Service Category 1 and include:</P><P>— Lot 1a: Rosewood Court, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, NN8 1LQ,</P><P>— Lot 1b: Sunley Court, Kettering, Northamptonshire, NN15 7RJ,</P><P>— Lot 2a: Imperial Court, Rushden, Northamptonshire, NN10 9AF,</P><P>— Lot 2b: St Crispin’s Court, St Crispin Dr, Northampton NN5 4RB,</P><P>— Lot 3: Langdale Court, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, NN8 3XA.</P><P>Providers that are interested in providing services to the extra care housing schemes must submit the appropriate lot questionnaire at the same time as they apply to the CSSH Framework.
